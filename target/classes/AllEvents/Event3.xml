        You walk down the trail for what seems like forever. Is this the right way?
        About an hour has passed and the forest seems to only get darker.
        The trail is getting more and more narrow until it’s barely a trodden path.
        Suddenly you can’t see the path anymore, you turn around and all you see is the deep, dark forest.
        Where did you come from? Where did you go? Where did you come from Cotton Eyed Joe?

        What would you like to do?
