        You turn right, because right is right, right?
        You walk for about an hour or two, before the path suddenly gets wider and wider.
        You continue walking and the ground goes from being a dirt path to cobblestone, and the trees grow more and more sparse.
        The path leads you to another crossroad.
        To the left, the path seems to go back towards the forest,
        to the right an endless cobblestone path as far as you can see.

        What would you like to do?
