        You walk closer to the bush, it sounds like a small creature moving around.
        You walk even closer and peek through the twigs. A rabbit is looking up at you.
        Your empty stomach is reminding you that you canâ€™t remember when you last ate something.
        You realize that if you want to kill the small creature, you better act quickly!

        What would you like to do?
