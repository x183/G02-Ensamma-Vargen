        You wake up alone in a dark forest. You can’t remember what you were doing there.  Or.. even who you are. You look through your clothes after clues, and find a letter in your pocket. It’s ripped, but you manage to read “please, you have to help me find her before it’s too late”.
        Find who? and who wrote this? At least you know you're on some kind of a mission, if the letter is even for you..
        You look around and see a trail to your right and a trail to your left. The left trail seems to be leading toward a deeper part of the forest. The right trail is leading towards a huge mountain you are pretty sure you haven’t seen before.
        Are you even in your village anymore?
